# Portfolio
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Thamber and this is my ever-changing portfolio. <br> Why, you may ask that it is ever-changing? Well, I believe that a portfolio is never actually completed, that there is always something more to put on it. Same as a project that is done. The project may be done in your eyes, but the project can always be progressed on with more ideas.</p>
<br>

<p>A little bit about me, before you go onto the site?
<br>
I'm a front-end developer with a year of experience in coding (so far), of which I have built and adjusted both responsive websites and landing pages for a company (Profusion), as well as some mockups for my own projects, which I believe you will find interesting in my Portfolio.
<br>
I would say that I am proficient in HTML and CSS and am currently working through my knowledge of JS as well as the more intuitive frameworks of CSS and HTML.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> So without further ado, here is my Portfolio...</p>
